# Java Interview Prep 

This repository contains my daily Java practice focused on
**QA / SDET interview preparation**.

The goal of this repository is to strengthen:
- Core Java fundamentals
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
- Problem-solving using Java
- QA automation–oriented design and utility classes

All problems are practiced consistently and organized in a
clean, maintainable structure similar to real automation frameworks.

Each question includes:
- Problem statement
